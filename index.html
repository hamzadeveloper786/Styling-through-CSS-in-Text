        <span>papermoney</span>, or simply a <span>note</span>-is a type of <a

            href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promissory_note">promissory note</a> , made by a <a
            href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank">bank</a> or other licensed authority, payable to the
        bearer on
        demand. Banknotes were originally issued by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_bank">commercial
            banks</a>, which were legally required to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redemption_value">
            redeem</a> the
        notes for <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_tender">legal tender</a> (usually
        gold or silver coin) when presented to the chief cashier of the orignating bank. These commercial banknotes only
        traded a face value in the market served by the issuing bank. Commercial banknotes have primarily been replaced
        by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank">central bank</a> or <a

        Banknotes with a face value of ten in the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar">United
            States dollar</a>,<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling">pound sterling</a> as
        issued by the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England">Bank of England</a>

        National banknotes are often - but not always - <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_tender">legal
            tender</a>, meaning that courts of law are
        required to
        recognize them as satisfactory payment of money <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt">debts</a>.
        Histrocally, banks sought to ensure that
        they could
        always pay customers in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin">coins</a> when they presented banknotes
        for payment. This practice of
        "backing" notes with
        something of substance is the basis of the history of <a
            href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank">central banks</a> backing their currencies in
        gold or silver.
        Today, most national currencies have no backing in <a
            href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_metal">precious metals</a> or commodities and have value
        only by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money">fiat</a>.
        With the exception of non-circulating high-value or precious metal issues,<a
            href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin">coins</a> are used for
        lower valued
        monetary units, while banknotes are used for higher values.

        <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Carthage">Carthage</a> was pruported to have issued bank notes
        on parchement or leather before 146 BC. Hence
        Carthage may be
        the oldest user of lighweight promissory notes. The first known banknote was <a
